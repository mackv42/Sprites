# Sprites
Web application for managing sprite sheets

Organize and manage sprite sheets by creating frames over them and download json about the data you created.
Core Functionality:
  creating frames by mouse click
  Naming frames
  Adding frames to different groups
  'Autoframe' function that automatically frames clustered pixels that are visible

# Todo
Show group of frames when selected
Animate groups of frames in app

# Bugs
Some funny behavior with auto frame function sometimes will create multiple frames over 1 sprite
Certain ways spritesheets are organized will cause it to create a large frame over 1 group
